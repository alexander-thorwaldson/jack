## Running Tests

```bash
# All tests
make test

# Unit tests only (fast)
make test-unit

# Integration tests
make test-integration

# Benchmarks
make test-bench
```

## Writing Tests

### Test Files

- Maintain 1:1 relationship between source files and test files
- `api.go` → `api_test.go`
- Exception: delegation-only files may omit tests

### Using Helpers

Import the testing package:

```go
import "github.com/zoobzio/jack/testing"
```

### Coverage Targets

- Project floor: 70%
- New code (patch): 80%
